About the Project:

This project is a Netflix Clone frontend created using only HTML and CSS. The main objective of building this clone was to practice frontend web development skills and understand how to design and structure a real-world website layout. This clone focuses completely on the UI/UX (User Interface and User Experience) of Netflix.

It includes a navigation bar, hero banner section, movie/show thumbnails, and a footer—all styled to closely resemble the Netflix homepage. The website layout is also responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
